# KameSame Open Framework

KameSame Open Framework ("`ksof`") is a user-created framework for rapidly developing web browser userscripts for use with the Japanese kanji learning site [kamesame.com](https://www.kamesame.com).

This basically uses the Wanikani Open Framework as a base, and modifies it to be somewhat compatible with KameSame.
